README for the heat propagation project
=======================================

This directory contains various C files containing helper code for the
heat propagation project.

You can use this in either of two ways:

- either by creating your own project tree and copying the individual
  C sources over; or

- reusing this tree as-is.

We suggest that you use the latter approach if you are not comfortable
writing Unix Makefiles. This tree uses GNU Automake which automates
Makefile generation from simple definitions in ``Makefile.am``.

About the C language level
--------------------------

You are allowed to, but not required to, make use of "new" language
features from ISO C99 (those recognized by the compilers we have
access to).

This can be enabled for the GNU compiler with options ``-std=c99`` or
``-std=gnu99``. These options are already enabled by default with the
provided skeleton code. Of specific interest for this project are:

- multi-dimensional array declarations of dynamic sizes;

- the ``restrict`` keyword.

About source code submissions
-----------------------------

Regardless of your choice to reuse the code in this directory or
create your own project directory, your submissions are expected to
comply to the following guidelines:

- you should submit a compressed TAR archive, whose name contains your
  student ID and which expands into a subdirectory whose name also
  contains your student ID;

- if your submitted tree contains a ``configure`` script, we will run
  it without parameters before compiling the code;

- your program(s) should compile with the command ``make``.

If you use the proposed code skeleton, you can create a valid archive
automatically with the command ``make distcheck
distdir=heat-STUDENTID`` (replace "STUDENTID" by your student ID).

here is an example sequence of shell commands which checks whether your
submission complies to these guidelines::

  set -e
  ID=<yourstudentID>
  tar -xzf *$ID*.tar.gz # or .tbz or .tgz or .t7z etc
  cd *$ID*/
  test -x ./configure && ./configure
  make

About input/output data files
-----------------------------

The proposed code makes use of the *portable greymap* file format from
the Netpbm_ software suite. This is an image format which is also
editable as plain text.

.. _Netpbm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm

You do not need the Netpbm programs for this project since many image
viewers will recognize the image format anyways.

We will provide a few data files. They can be automatically generated
using the rules in ``data.mk``. You can use the same rules to generate
similar images of different sizes. For example::

   make gradient_500x100.pgm
   make plasma_100x100.pgm
   make areas_100x500.pgm

You are also invited to create your own test files or "interesting
patterns" as well.

About reusing this tree
-----------------------

If you decide to reuse the provided tree as-is, you delegate to GNU
Autoconf and GNU Automake the task of selecting compilers and
authoring your ``Makefile``.

GNU Automake should be smart enough to pick-up any changes to your
files whenever you run the ``make`` command. If any issues arise,
contact us for troubleshooting.

Suggestions
-----------

- Always compile your code with compiler warnings enabled,
  e.g. ``-Wall -W`` with GNU C. Note that potential uses of
  unitialized variables are only detected by GCC when using
  optimization level ``-O2``.

- If you are using GNU Automake, you can produce a valid submission
  archive automatically using the rule ``make distcheck``. You can
  change the name of the directory and archive as follows::

         make distcheck distdir=heat-XXXXX

  (e.g. replace "XXXXX" with your student ID)

- If your program outputs a series of images (e.g. ``img.XXX.pgm`` as
  done by the code in ``img.c``), you can convert these images to a
  colored GIF or MPEG animation using the following command::

     convert <file list> +level-colors blue-red anim.gif

  If you are reusing this directory as-is, you can also run ``make
  anim.gif`` which has the same effect (rule in ``data.mk``).

  .. note:: The ``convert`` command is provided by ImageMagick_
     (version 6.2.4-1 or later for option ``+level-colors``).

  .. _ImageMagick: http://www.imagemagick.org/

- You can overload the C compile flags temporarily for the duration of
  one build by using the following command::

     make CFLAGS="<your flags here>"

  To make the flags persist more::

     ./configure CFLAGS="<your flags here>"

  
- Thanks to GNU Automake, you can separate the build process from the
  source tree. This is done by creating an empty directory, changing
  to this directory to make it current, and then running the
  ``configure`` script from there. For example::

     mkdir test-o2
     cd test-o2
     ../path/to/sources/configure CFLAGS=-O2
     make

  This is also useful to keep multiple builds of your programs in
  different directories while keeping a single source tree, e.g. when
  testing the effect of different compiler flags side by side.


Auoreconf
---------

In order to prepare the build system run:
- autoreconf -v -f -i
